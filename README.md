# discord-event-bot
A discord bot that can parse a steam groups event page, display the schedule, and send out reminders of upcoming events

Run it with event-bot -c conf.json with a properly edited configuration file

This has been mostly deprecated unless you still wish to do some sort of basic integration with a steam group calendar.  Otherwise investigate:

This allows you to create your own simple in-discord events and send notifications to users and tags
